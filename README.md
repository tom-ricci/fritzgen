So, I have this friend Fritz who enjoys this game and recently the community has been a bit of a mess, right. Soooo y'know crablang? This is the exact same concept. I'll be touching this repo either never or very little so no guarantees it will work. Honestly I barely even know what this game is about so ¯\\\_\(ツ\)\_\/¯

## Requirements
- python >= 3.8
- pygame >= 2.1.3.dev8
- pygame_gui >= 0.6.8
- and more, please install dependencies!

## Setting up
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. 

## Running game
